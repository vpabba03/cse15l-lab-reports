- In this example, I wanted to determine specifically which `journal.pbio` files were oriented towards the medical field in the `/plos` directory. Using the `-c` command, I was able to determine that `journal.pbio.0020063.txt` could be the most medically oriented because `medical` was used the most in it.

### Example 2
```
[cs15lfa22if@ieng6-202]:technical:229$ cd 911report
[cs15lfa22if@ieng6-202]:911report:230$ grep -c "World Trade Center" chapter-9.txt                                       
16                
```
- In this example, I used the `grep -c` command to determine how many times the World Trade Center is mentioned in the text file. This could be useful when trying to determine the how many times a word is used in a text.

### Example 3
```
[cs15lfa22if@ieng6-202]:911report:254$ grep -c "PREFACE" *.txt                                                          chapter-1.txt:0                                                                                                         chapter-10.txt:0                                                                                                        chapter-11.txt:0                                                                                                        chapter-12.txt:0                                                                                                        chapter-13.1.txt:0                                                                                                      chapter-13.2.txt:0                                                                                                      chapter-13.3.txt:0                                                                                                      chapter-13.4.txt:0                                                                                                      chapter-13.5.txt:0                                                                                                      chapter-2.txt:0                                                                                                         chapter-3.txt:0                                                                                                         chapter-5.txt:0                                                                                                         chapter-6.txt:0                                                                                                         chapter-7.txt:0                                                                                                         chapter-8.txt:0                                                                                                         chapter-9.txt:0                                                                                                         preface.txt:1                
```
- In this example, I used the `PREFACE` keyword in order to find the text file with the preface for the narrative. This would be very useful in the case someone wanted to find a certain chapter or section within multiple text files, but it was not explicitly stated within the file names.

## Command Line Option #2: `grep -w`

- The `grep -w` command can allow the user to print out all the sentences containing a certain keyword taken as an argument for the command.

### Example 1
```
[cs15lfa22if@ieng6-203]:911report:261$ grep -w strategy chapter-12.txt                                                                  consider what to do-the shape and objectives of a strategy. Americans should also                                   This vagueness blurs the strategy. The catastrophic threat at this moment in history                                        our strategy must match our means to two ends: dismantling the al Qaeda network and                                     political-military strategy that rests on a firm tripod of policies to                                                  Yet the strategy should be balanced.                                                                                Certainly the strategy should include offensive operations to counter terrorism.                                            flourish. America's strategy should be a coalition strategy, that includes Muslim                                       accompanied by a preventive strategy that is as much, or more, political as it is                                       military. The strategy must focus clearly on the Arab and Muslim world, in all its                                  Our strategy should also include defenses. America can be attacked in many ways and                                             strategy to keep possible terrorists insecure and on the run, using all elements                                        strategy of "enlightened moderation." The Muslim world, he said, should shun                                            country, with a strategy and nation-by-nation commitments to achieve their                                          long-range strategy, one that invigorates our foreign policy with the attention that                                    respect for different beliefs is a key element in any global strategy to eliminate                                      Recommendation: A comprehensive U.S. strategy to counter terrorism                                                  Practically every aspect of U.S.counterterrorism strategy relies on international                                               developing a comprehensive coalition strategy against Islamist terrorism. There                                         hammering out a common strategy for the places where terrorists may be finding                                      like trying to catch one kind of fish by draining the ocean. A better strategy has                                          terrorist travel intelligence, operations, and law enforcement in a strategy to                                     a vital part of counterterrorism strategy. Better technology and training to detect
```
- In this example, I used the `grep -w` command to print out every single line that has a specific keyword in it. In this case, I wanted to print out every single line that had the word `strategy` in the `chapter-12.txt` file. This could be useful if someone wanted to get a general understanding of the content of a file by actually reading through the relevant sentences that contains a certain keyword.

Ten Commissioners-five Republicans and five                                             Democrats chosen by elected leaders from our nation's capital at a time of great                                        partisan division-have come together to present this report without dissent.                                        We have come together with a unity of purpose because our nation demands it.                                                September 11, 2001, was a day of unprecedented shock and suffering in the history of                                    the United States. The nation was unprepared. How did this happen, and how can we                                       avoid such tragedy again?                                                                                           To answer these questions, the Congress and the President created the National                                              Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (Public Law 107-306, November                                    27, 2002).                                                                                                          Our mandate was sweeping. The law directed us to investigate "facts and circumstances                                       relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001," including those relating                                      to intelligence agencies, law enforcement agencies, diplomacy, immigration issues                                       and border control, the flow of assets to terrorist organizations, commercial                                           aviation, the role of congressional oversight and resource allocation, and other                                        areas determined relevant by the Commission. In pursuing our mandate, we have                                           reviewed more than 2.5 million pages of documents and interviewed more than 1,200                                       individuals in ten countries. This included nearly every senior official from the                                       current and previous administrations who had responsibility for topics covered in                                       our mandate. We have sought to be independent, impartial, thorough, and nonpartisan.                                    From the outset, we have been committed to share as much of our investigation as we                                     can with the American people. To that end, we held 19 days of hearings and took                                         public testimony from 160 witnesses.                                                                                Our aim has not been to assign individual blame. Our aim has been to provide the                                            fullest possible account of the events surrounding 9/11 and to identify lessons                                         learned.                                                                                                            We learned about an enemy who is sophisticated, patient, disciplined, and lethal. The                                       enemy rallies broad support in the Arab and Muslim world by demanding redress of                                        political grievances, but its hostility toward us and our values is limitless. Its                                      purpose is to rid the world of religious and political pluralism, the plebiscite,                                       and equal rights for women. It makes no distinction between military and civilian                                       targets. Collateral damage is not in its lexicon.                                                                   We learned that the institutions charged with protecting our borders, civil aviation,                                       and national security did not understand how grave this threat could be, and did not                                    adjust their policies, plans, and practices to deter or defeat it. We learned of                                        fault lines within our government-between foreign and domestic intelligence, and                                        between and within agencies. We learned of the pervasive problems of managing and                                       sharing information across a large and unwieldy government that had been built in a                                     different era to confront different dangers.                                                                        At the outset of our work, we said we were looking backward in order to look forward.                                       We hope that the terrible losses chronicled in this report can create something                                         positive-an America that is safer, stronger, and wiser. That September day, we came                                     together as a nation. The test before us is to sustain that unity of purpose and                                        meet the challenges now confronting us. We need to design a balanced strategy for                                       the long haul, to attack terrorists and prevent their ranks from swelling while at                                      the same time protecting our country against future attacks. We have been forced to                                     think about the way our government is organized. The massive departments and                                            agencies that prevailed in the great struggles of the twentieth century must work                                       together in new ways, so that all the instruments of national power can be combined.                                    Congress needs dramatic change as well to strengthen oversight and focus                                                accountability.                                                                                                     As we complete our final report, we want to begin by thanking our fellow                                                    Commissioners, whose dedication to this task has been profound. We have reasoned                                        together over every page, and the report has benefited from this remarkable                                             dialogue. We want to express our considerable respect for the intellect and judgment                                    of our colleagues, as well as our great affection for them.                                                         We want to thank the Commission staff. The dedicated professional staff, headed by                                          Philip Zelikow, has contributed innumerable hours to the completion of this report,                                     setting aside other important endeavors to take on this all-consuming assignment.                                       They have conducted the exacting investigative work upon which the Commission has                                       built. They have given good advice, and faithfully carried out our guidance. They                                       have been superb. We thank the Congress and the President. Executive branch agencies                                    have searched records and produced a multitude of documents for us. We thank                                            officials, past and present, who were generous with their time and provided us with                                     insight. The PENTTBOM team at the FBI, the Director's Review Group at the CIA, and                                      Inspectors General at the Department of Justice and the CIA provided great                                              assistance. We owe a huge debt to their investigative labors, painstaking attention                                     to detail, and readiness to share what they have learned. We have built on the work                                     of several previous Commissions, and we thank the Congressional Joint Inquiry, whose                                    fine work helped us get started. We thank the City of New York for assistance with                                      documents and witnesses, and the Government Printing Office and W.W. Norton                                             & Company for helping to get this report to the broad public.                                                       We conclude this list of thanks by coming full circle: We thank the families of 9/11,                                       whose persistence and dedication helped create the Commission. They have been with                                      us each step of the way, as partners and witnesses. They know better than any of us                                     the importance of the work we have undertaken.                                                                      We want to note what we have done, and not done. We have endeavored to provide the                                          most complete account we can of the events of September 11, what happened and why.                                      This final report is only a summary of what we have done, citing only a fraction of                                     the sources we have consulted. But in an event of this scale, touching so many                                          issues and organizations, we are conscious of our limits. We have not interviewed                                       every knowledgeable person or found every relevant piece of paper. New information                                      inevitably will come to light. We present this report as a foundation for a better                                      understanding of a landmark in the history of our nation.                                                           We have listened to scores of overwhelming personal tragedies and astounding acts of                                        heroism and bravery. We have examined the staggering impact of the events of 9/11 on                                    the American people and their amazing resilience and courage as they fought back. We                                    have admired their determination to do their best to prevent another tragedy while                                      preparing to respond if it becomes necessary. We emerge from this investigation with                                    enormous sympathy for the victims and their loved ones, and with enhanced respect                                       for the American people. We recognize the formidable challenges that lie ahead.                                     We also approach the task of recommendations with humility. We have made a limited                                          number of them. We decided consciously to focus on recommendations we believe to be                                     most important, whose implementation can make the greatest difference. We came into                                     this process with strong opinions about what would work. All of us have had to                                          pause, reflect, and sometimes change our minds as we studied these problems and                                         considered the views of others. We hope our report will encourage our fellow                                            citizens to study, reflect-and act.                                                                                 Thomas H. Kean, chair                                                                                                   Lee H. Hamilton, vice chair

- In this example, I used the `grep -w` to print out the entire content of the `preface.txt` file. This could be an alternative way to be able to read the content of the file in a quick and accessible manner.

- In this example, I searched multiple files in the `Alcohol_Problems` directory for the keyword `intervention`, which printed out all the sentences that contain the word in all files within the directory. This would be useful for searching for a word through multiple files, while also returning the full sentence and the file that contains the sentence for ease of readability.

## Command Line Option #3: `grep -l`

- The `grep -l` command allows the user to print out the names of all the files that contain a certain keyword that is taken in as an argument for the command.

### Example 1
```
[cs15lfa22if@ieng6-203]:plos:280$ grep "research" pmed.* | wc -l                                                       
382
```
- In this example, I basically found the number of time the word `research` was used in all the `pmed.*` files. This could be useful to determine the number of times something is mentioned in a file, for example you could see how many items were resolved if they were logged in a readable file type.
